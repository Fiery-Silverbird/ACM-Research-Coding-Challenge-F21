## [](https://github.com/ACM-Research/Coding-Challenge-F21#no-collaboration-policy)No Collaboration Policy

**You may not collaborate with anyone on this challenge.**  You  _are_  allowed to use Internet documentation. If you  _do_  use existing code (either from Github, Stack Overflow, or other sources),  **please cite your sources in the README**.

## [](https://github.com/ACM-Research/Coding-Challenge-F21#submission-procedure)Submission Procedure

Please follow the below instructions on how to submit your answers.

1.  Create a  **public**  fork of this repo and name it  `ACM-Research-Coding-Challenge-F21`. To fork this repo, click the button on the top right and click the "Fork" button.

2.  Clone the fork of the repo to your computer using  `git clone [the URL of your clone]`. You may need to install Git for this (Google it).

3.  Complete the Challenge based on the instructions below.

4.  Submit your solution by filling out this [form](https://acmutd.typeform.com/to/zF1IcBGR).

## Assessment Criteria 

Submissions will be evaluated holistically and based on a combination of effort, validity of approach, analysis, adherence to the prompt, use of outside resources (encouraged), promptness of your submission, and other factors. Your approach and explanation (detailed below) is the most weighted criteria, and partial solutions are accepted. 

## [](https://github.com/ACM-Research/Coding-Challenge-S21#question-one)Question One

[Sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) is a natural language processing technique that computes a sentiment score for a body of text. This sentiment score can quantify how positive, negative, or neutral the text is. The following dataset in  `input.txt`  contains a relatively large body of text.

**Determine an overall sentiment score of the text in this file, explain what this score means, and contrast this score with what you expected.**  If your solution also provides different metrics about the text (magnitude, individual sentence score, etc.), feel free to add it to your explanation.   

**You may use any programming language you feel most comfortable. We recommend Python because it is the easiest to implement. You're allowed to use any library/API you want to implement this**, just document which ones you used in this README file. Try to complete this as soon as possible as submissions are evaluated on a rolling basis.

Regardless if you can or cannot answer the question, provide a short explanation of how you got your solution or how you think it can be solved in your README.md file. However, we highly recommend giving the challenge a try, you just might learn something new!

## Solution

I used the VADER Sentiment Analysis library to analyze the input text file for a sentimental analysis rating
which returned an overall sentiment score of 0.9978 when passed as a whole block of text, implying that the overall text is positive. 
I also passed individual sentences to the VADER Sentiment Analysis library with the help of the nltk library's tokenize function and the average score from the compound score of 
the sentimental analysis of each line was also positive with a value of 0.1206. This is a far better result than I expected as through my readthrough, I deduced the intent of the first paragraph to be a comedic play of sorts with the exaggerated descriptions of the reactions of people with an overall positive sentiment as it was making a joke/light of the situation and the second paragraph was overwhelmingly positive. I expected the analyzer to misunderstand the intent
in the first paragraph and skew towards the negative as it was filled with negatively connotated words such as rage, murder etc but instead it deduced the whole text as positive regardless of the six negatively connotated sentences in the text.
